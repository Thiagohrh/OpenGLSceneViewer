## The Project
OpenGL scene viewer, where you can move the camera around, and load objects (.obj files) in it.
Made using OpenGL, and following the methods described in https://learnopengl.com/. 

### How To Use It
Open the Visual Studio solution and compile the Exercise4 project. There is a *sceneDirectory* variable that defines the path to the file that will be used to load the scene. The program uses formats in .cgs format, which is a unique format for this project. There is a sample file in the *scenes* folder. The structure of the file is explained within the *readerCGS.h* header
